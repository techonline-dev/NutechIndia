                      quality of life. Therefore it is imperative that your timely health monitoring by examination and
                      tests will help identify a disease early and offer opportunities to address it immediately; even in
                      individuals who appear to be feeling well and complacent and therefore do not feel the urgency to take
                      ownership of their health. We are slowly but certainly learning that regular screening for general
                      health is cheaper especially if any problems are detected early and are promptly treated. For this
                      article, we discuss the currently available diagnostic tests (and not on treatments) and focus
                      specifically on the importance and urgency of prostate cancer awareness and monitoring in every man

                        http://cancerindia.org.in/cp/index.php/know-about-cancer/prostate-cancer, [1].</a></u></p>
                    <p>Among males, prostate cancer is now the third leading cancer site in India (followed by lung and
                      esophageal cancer) [2]. In its 2016 projection, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
                      estimated the total number of new cancer cases in India is expected to be approximately 14.5 lakh (1.4
                      million), out of which 50,000 (0.05 million) new cases are of prostate cancer alone, and the figure is
                      likely to reach 60,000 (0.06 million) from the nearly 17.3 lakh (1.7 million) additional new cases
              estimated in 2020. There are several myths that have been addressed by Dr. Gautam <u><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-10-myths-prostate-cancer-india-dr-gagan-gautam">(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-10-myths-prostate-cancer-india-dr-gagan-gautam)</a></u>
                      . This helps our
                      cause further; on monitoring prostate health as a serious health issue that need to be seriously
                      considered by every male over 40 years of age for implementing early cancer detection [3]. Previously
                      published study has shown that prostate cancer incidence in India thus far show an urgent need for
                      implementing new and improved diagnostics and strengthening treatment facilities, which are currently
                      inadequate to the current patient load [4]. Generally, cancer biomarkers are used to detect the
                      natural course of a tumor and to assess chances of developing cancer. Cancer biomarkers can also be
                      used in diagnosis, risk assessment and recurrence of cancer. Effective cancer biomarkers are used to
                      reduce cancer mortality rates by facilitating diagnosis of cancers at early stages. §The global
                      biomarkers market for biomarker industry is expected to grow 2-fold from 2013 to $53.6 billion in
                      2018, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8%. Currently, North America is accounted for the
                      largest share of the cancer biomarkers market, followed by Europe, Asia-Pacific, and The Rest of World
                      (ROW). *However, the future growth of the cancer biomarkers market will be driven by the Asia-Pacific
                      region, owing to the rising cancer incidence, increasing use of biomarker tests for diagnosis,
                      expansions of major pharmaceutical companies in emerging Asian economies, and government support to
                      research institutes and universities. Although revenue for this biotechnology sector is expected to
              continue to grow steadily; it is predicted to peak even higher in 2017 as it did in 2014. </p>
                    <h4><strong>2.0 SeroMark-1 test results may help to find prostate cancer early even before there are
                symptoms:</strong></h4>
                    <p>The current routine tests for Prostate cancers are: (1) Digital Rectal examination- it can catch the
                      disease early when it’s most treatable. (2) Prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test (normal range
                      is 0-4 ng/dL) – when the results of the blood are high it MAY indicate cancer. After the tests above
                      are performed and show any signs of Cancer, then the doctors use other resources to distinguish
                      between noncancerous and cancerous areas; like CT-Scan, X- rays, scope and ultrasound etc. These tests
                      are considered by many patients invasive, inaccurate and costly. Historically, serum total PSA
                      (Prostate Specific Antigen) has been used as a prostate cancer (PCa) biomarker although recently its
                      utility has been controversial due to lack of specificity. PSA tests aren't foolproof and there is no
                      known "normal". It's possible for PSA levels to be elevated when cancer isn't present, and to not be
                      elevated when cancer is present. Neither the PSA test nor the rectal examination (DRE) is 100%
                      accurate and can give an abnormal result even when cancer is not present (known as a false positive
                      result). In addition, normal results can occur even when cancer is present (false negative). Even if
                      PSA level is raised, this could be for reasons other than prostate cancer and you may have unnecessary
                      stress. This is very important since the results of PSA and DRE screenings lead to both under and over
                      treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). This is a major problem posed for the physicians and treatment
                      centers. SeroMark-1 testing currently slated to be launched in India will address that problem.
                      Therefore, SeroMark-1 testing is filling that void and will be made significantly affordable at
                      US$57/test (90% off from what it costs in USA) specifically in India for early detection of prostate
              cancer from serum (no biopsy required) [5].</p>
                    <p>SeroMark-1 test consists of examining concentrations of specific phospholipids in human blood
                      (serum). Phospholipids are a subclass of a large and diverse group of organic compounds called lipids.
                      They are building blocks of cellular membranes. An independent University preclinical research study
                      demonstrated a ground-breaking discovery that altered levels of these three phospholipids may serve as
              early predictive serum markers for the presence or absence of PCa [6]. </p>
                    <p>Because prostate cancer often grows very slowly, some men (especially those who are older or have
                      other serious health problems) might never need treatment for their prostate cancer. Instead, their
                      doctors may recommend approaches known as expectant management, watchful waiting, observation, or
                      active surveillance. Treatment can be started if the cancer seems to be growing or getting worse,
                      based on abnormal SeroMark-1 test, a rising PSA level or a change in the DRE, ultrasound findings, or
                      biopsy results. On biopsies, an increase in the Gleason score or extent of tumor (based on the number
                      of biopsy samples containing tumor) are both signals to start treatment (usually surgery or radiation
                      therapy). In active surveillance, only men whose cancer are rapidly growing (and therefore have a more
                      serious form of cancer) are treated. This lets men with less serious cancer take control of their
                      health decisions and quality of life thereby avoiding the side effects and helped them live longer.
            </p>
                    <p>With a high PSA level one may need further tests such as a biopsy, which can be painful and lead to
                      blood in urine, semen or stools. Occasionally having a biopsy can lead to infection of the prostate
                      gland, which can be difficult to treat. A need and therefore a push for discovering alternative
                      biomarkers has led to several US FDA approved and clinical laboratory-based tests with improved
                      sensitivity and specificity over PSA (Table 1). SeroMark-1 test is not replacing PSA test but is the
                      answer.

                symptoms:</strong></h4>
                    <p>Surprisingly, serum PSA is still being used in conjunction with other clinical parameters in all of
                      these tests, highlighting the inimitable role of PSA in the overall clinical management of prostate
                      cancer [7]. None of the currently available biomarkers can predict absence of prostate cancer versus
                      cancer upon routine screening from serum except SeroMark-1 test; which will assist with the early
                      diagnosis of prostate cancer without any discomfort or some of the discrepancies of the current
                      methods [8]. For example, the Prostate Health Index (PHI) test measures total PSA as well as two
                      special forms of the protein: free PSA (fPSA), and pro2PSA. Using these three values, a PHI score is
                      calculated for prostate cancer risk. Larger the number of Area under curve (AUC) higher is the
                      accuracy in prediction AUC: 0.67 (Cost: US$500). Secondly, a PCA3 (prostate cancer gene 3) scoring
                      test is a simple urine test used to predict the likelihood of prostate cancer with AUC: 0.68 (Cost:
                      US$500) and, the 4K test is a simple blood test that detects high risk, aggressive prostate cancer. It
                      measures four prostate protein (prostate-specific kallikreins) levels in your blood including total
                      PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and human kallikrein 2 (hK2). The results of 4K test are combined in an
                      algorithm with patient age, digital rectal exam and prior negative biopsy to give physicians a
                      personal score for each patient with AUC: 0.82 (Cost: US$1200). Intriguingly, Seromark-1 testing using
                      a combination of the three phospholipids (ePC 38:5, PC 40:3 and PC 42:4), resulted in an area under
                      curve (AUC) of 0.9157 (US$300).

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Thus SeroMark-1 test is the only biomarker that can distinguish prostate cancer versus normal from
                serum without a need of biopsy confirmation. </p>

                    <p>1. SeroMark-1 is the ONLY specific serum-based biomarkers currently available to stratify prostate
              cancer versus normal individuals or to potentially detect micro-metastasis.<br />
                      2. Safe and effective detection method. Less invasive compared to biopsy. <br />
                      3. One test per 6 months or per year. <br />
                      4. Combination with other tests can increase sensitivity and specificity.<br />
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>WEAKNESSES</strong></h4>
                    <p>1. False-positives or –negatives requiring additional tests.<br />
                      2. Requires expensive instrument and maintenance for analysis of sera.<br />
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>OPPORTUNITIES</strong></h4>
                    <p>1. Health care plans to include SeroMark-1.<br />
                      2. Identify PCa early in 0.05 million men projected to have prostate cancer in India.<br />
                      3. Market research indicated people preferring early detection versus tests dependent on painful
              biopsy.<br />
                    </p>
                    <h4><strong>THREATS</strong></h4>
                    <p>1. Although time-consuming FDA (USA) approval is not required, FDA can impose regulations later.<br />
                      2. Other superior detection methods in competition.<br />
                      3. Deceptive marketing claims. <br />
                      SeroMark-1 test is additionally helpful if used in conjunction with Prostate specific antigen (PSA)
                      based tests to help physicians and their patients make the most informed decision on the need for
                      invasive testing. The SeroMark-1 test may help give more information before you make the decision for
                      biopsy or no biopsy. In a small number of men, a biopsy may not always detect a significant cancer
                      even when it is present. The SeroMark-1 test may offer additional information to pursue additional
                      testing to discover a significant cancer after a negative biopsy. One will need to seriously consult
                      your physician for further evaluation if: 1. SeroMark-1 is abnormal and PSA is lower than 4 ng/dL, or
              2. SeroMark-1 is abnormal and PSA is higher than 4 ng/dL.<br /><br /></p>
                    <h4><strong>4.0 Summary:</strong></h4>
                    <p>In summary, 1) Even though there are several of new biomarkers that have been exhaustively studied
                      recently, and some of them for many years and recommended for their use with different guidelines,
                      continuance of prospective and comparative studies is necessary to establish their value in prostate
                      cancer detection (diagnosis) and prognosis [9], 2) There are currently no biomarkers that can
                      accurately distinguish aggressive versus non-aggressive (indolent tumors), inspite of tremendous
                      advances in genomic and proteomic based technologies [8], 3) Efforts on alternative biomarkers
                      replacing PSA completely continues to be a challenge, and 4) Continued validation of emerging new
                      powerful and unique biomarkers such as SeroMark-1 will help. Thus, implementation of early detection
                      for prostate health management and better treatment options for managing prostate cancer is urgently
              needed. SeroMark-1 is the leader. Let’s take care of your prostate health.</p>

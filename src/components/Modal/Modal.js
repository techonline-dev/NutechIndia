        As you may already know, biologic markers (biomarkers) are being used to screen, detect and diagnose many individuals, help in prognostic evaluation, monitor treatment response, and predict disease recurrence.  We are offering our service called SeroMark-1 test for detecting the presence or absence of prostate cancer, that may direct the conversation toward personalized medicine and targeted therapies, or toward other testing and treatment modalities appropriate for you.
        <br /><br />By participating in the SeroMark-1 testing opportunity, you recognize and accept all risks associated with the screening process.  You understand that you may still need to conduct DRE (digital rectal exam), PSA (prostate specific antigen) test or any other relevant tests and that blood draw for Seromark-1 analysis does not constitute a complete medical exam or diagnosis for prostate cancer.
        <br /><br />You hereby release NUTECH CANCER BIOMARKERS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED, and any other organization involved with either NUTECH CANCER BIOMARKERS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED or their agents, from all liabilities, medical claims or expenses which may arise from your participation or injury sustained during this testing.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>How much personal and medical information should I share?</strong>
        <br />You have a choice as to how much or how little information you want to share. For example, you can consent just to having your blood collected and tested. Or you can consent to sharing personal information such as your age, current medications, racial or ethnic group, and history of smoking. You can also allow access to your medical record. The choice is yours.  Knowing this information may help researchers understand how these factors affect the risk of prostate cancer. And being able to study patientsâ€™ blood/tissues in light of their medical histories may tell scientists a lot more about the causes of cancer and how to develop new therapies
        <br /><br />
        <strong>How will my privacy be protected?</strong>
        <br />Indian government laws and regulations protect the privacy and confidentiality of your medical information. We may consult a committee at a hospital, known as the Institutional Review Board, or IRB, which will review the plan to make sure that it strictly follows these laws and regulations.
        <br />Several procedures have been put into place to protect the privacy of your medical record information.  For example, direct identifiers (such as your name, Aadhaar Card #, PAN #, telephone number, address) will be encoded as ID# and removed from the information before it is sent for analysis or if provided to the researchers.  Only honest broker or your physician will have access to your identifiable medical record information, and these individuals will be required to sign a privacy agreement.  However, just as with the use of your medical information for health care purposes, we cannot guarantee its privacy.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>What are the financial implications to SeroMark-1 analysis?</strong>
        <br />There is either a waiver or an upfront charge of Rs. 4000/test to you, or to your insurance company. At the same time, you will not be paid any fee for your blood or for any of the discoveries that might result from analysis/research using your blood
        <br /><br />
        <strong>What if I change my mind after giving blood or blood sample?</strong>
        <br />You can change your mind at any time about allowing your blood to be used in future research. The consent form explains how to contact the company. If you wish to withdraw your consent for all research or change the amount of personal information you are willing to share, tell the administrator at NUTECH CANCER BIOMARKERS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED immediately. However, if some of your blood has already been sent out, and/or the company cannot get it back, you cannot withdraw your permission for the research done on those particular blood samples
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Will I get the results of SeroMark-1 test?</strong>
        <br />Yes. The company can also directly communicate, in total confidentiality, the results of your blood analysis with your doctor/physician.  Other researchers will not report to you the results of any research using your donated blood. Research studies take many years and require blood samples from hundreds or thousands of people. The results are published in scientific journals or in media.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Will SeroMark-1 test results be shared with my employer or health insurance provider?</strong>
        <br />Results of your blood analysis will not be put in your medical record, and will not be released to your employer, health insurance provider, or anyone else
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Will SeroMark-1 test using my blood contribute to my medical care?</strong>
        <br />The results of blood analysis will not affect your care right now. If your cancer comes back in the future, however, new treatment options may be available
        <br /><br />
        <strong>How do I decide whether or not to give blood?</strong>
        <br />You decide; since you or your Insurance is paying for the analysis.  Feel free to talk it over with your doctor or nurse if you are unsure
        <br /><br />
